Find the one digit to be removed to form palindrome:
Assume that the given number input1 can become a palindrome if only one of its digit is removed. i.e. only one digit into the number is out of place. Find the digit that needs to be removed from input1 to convert input1 to a palindrome.
Example 1:input1=12332 the digit 1 is to be removed to convert input1 to palindrome.
So, return the Output=1
Example 2:input1=251532 the digit 3 is to be removed to convert input1 to palindrome.
So, return the Output=3
Example 3:input1=10101 no digit needs to be removed to the digit 1 is to be removed to convert input1 to palindrome. Because, it is already a palindrome.
So, return the Output=-1
Example 4:input1=981894 the digit 4 is to be removed to convert input1 to palindrome.
Return the Output=4
